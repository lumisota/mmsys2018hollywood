\section{TCP Hollywood}
\label{sec:hlywd}

TCP Hollywood \cite{mcquistin2016tcp, mcquistin2016tcp2} is an unordered and time-lined transport protocol.
While maintaining wire compatibility with standard TCP, TCP Hollywood removes two sources
of transport-layer latency: in-order delivery and reliability. In-order delivery
results in head-of-line blocking: data is not made available to the application until all 
earlier data has been delivered. Providing
reliability over a best-effort network requires retransmissions, adding latency while
loss is detected and retransmissions are sent. TCP Hollywood uses message-oriented
semantics, and eliminates head-of-line blocking by delivering these messages to the
receiver in the order that they arrive. TCP Hollywood also relaxes standard TCP's
reliability guarantee, providing \emph{partial} reliability instead. The TCP Hollywood
API allows applications to specify a deadline for each message, after which it will no
longer be sent -- this means that if a retransmission of a lost message is unlikely to
arrive before its deadline, it will not be sent; an unexpired message will be sent
instead (i.e., the retransmitted TCP segment's payload is different to the original transmission). 
Making use of this functionality requires that the application be aware of
the TCP Hollywood extensions and the content being sent, such that it can
set a deadline for each message. 

Under standard MPEG-DASH, when a frame is to be played out, but has not yet arrived, the
application will stall waiting for the missing data to arrive. When using standard TCP,
this is a sensible design choice: subsequent frames are not in the application buffer
either. However, when TCP Hollywood is used, and head-of-line blocking is eliminated,
later frames may be available to the application. This makes skipping frames a viable design
choice -- rather than waiting for the missing frame, it is better to use error concealment
techniques to minimise the impact of loss as much as possible and continue play-back. 
Deeper analysis of TCP Hollywood \cite{mcquistin2016tcp, mcquistin2016tcp2}, which
explores the impact of removing head-of-line blocking on application performance, has been
carried out.

The scope of this work is to evaluate the impact of HAS-over-TCP Hollywood on
video quality-of-experience, while minimising change at the application-layer (i.e., maintaining
alignment with the MPEG-DASH standard). For this reason, in the interest of keeping a
stateless server, we only use the unordered delivery feature of TCP Hollywood.
