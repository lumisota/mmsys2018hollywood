\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this work, we evaluated the effects of unordered delivery on MPEG-DASH clients, using TCP Hollywood. We
observed that by eliminating head-of-line blocking on a chunk and message level, 
an MPEG-DASH client using TCP
Hollywood is able to significantly reduce stall events while also slightly reducing start-up
delay and improving download quality. The observations and lessons learnt during the
course of this study can also be applied to other transports that support non-reliable
streams, such as SCTP and QUIC.
